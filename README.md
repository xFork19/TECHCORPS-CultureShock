# TECHCORPS-CultureShock

This is the code for the runner in SwiftUI for TechCorpsOhio's 30th annaversary hackathon. This website was created with 3 goals in mind.
        1. To inform the general public on local and global events around the world.
        2. To build awareness about situations of different communities.
        3. To build empathy and a movement that can combat global issues.
